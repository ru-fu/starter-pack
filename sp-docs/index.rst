Documentation starter pack
==========================

*A pre-configured repository to build and publish documentation with Sphinx.*

The documentation starter pack includes:

* a bundled Sphinx_ theme, configuration, and extensions
* support for both reStructuredText (reST) and Markdown
* build checks for links, spelling, and inclusive language
* customisation support layered above a core configuration

This starter pack contains the files you need to quickly set up your Sphinx documentation.

Before you start, see the information about `Read the Docs at Canonical`_ and the instructions for `How to publish documentation on Read the Docs`_.

Then, to start setting up your docs, see :ref:`enable` for instructions.
The `Example product documentation`_ shows how to set up a Di√°taxis structure in Sphinx.

For quick help on reST or MyST syntax, see the :file:`doc-cheat-sheet.rst.txt` or :file:`doc-cheat-sheet-myst.md.txt` files in the repository.
(Open the files in your text editor; the rendered output is not very useful.)

More information is available in the `reStructuredText style guide`_.
